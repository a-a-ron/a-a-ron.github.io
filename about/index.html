<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Alright, alright. I'm Aaron Stewart</h1>
	<p>I’m an integration engineer living in the heart of Silicon Slopes Utah Valley. It’s a nice place to live with the Rocky Mountains and outdoor adventures in almost every direction but the weather can be crazy unpredictable at times. Only Utahans can understand the struggle.</p>

		<figcaption>That's me. ⤴</figcaption>
	</div>
	<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.github.com/a-a-ron">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-stewart-4499a28a">Linkedin</a>, and,  if you want to see little square pictures i take of the world, i'm also on <a href="http://instagram.com/aaronstewart">Instagram</a>.</p>
	<p>I joined <a href="https://www.mx.com">MX</a> in 2015 as part of their delivery team to help partners architect an integration flow to MX’s APIs, and help build a product that continues to be the industry leader in the fintech space to gather, enrich, present, and act on data.</p>
	<p>Before that, i worked at <a href="https://www.Fishbowlinventory.com">Fishbowl</a> as a trainer for their inventory management software after taking some computer science courses at Utah Valley University and online courses at <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/in/general2?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=l1-AMER-SEM-Brand&cid=l1-us:en:ps:lp:prosc:s0:0:all:google:xct-lynda&utm_content=104753722386&utm_term=lynda&src=go-pa&veh=skwd-329556378_pcrid_104753722386_pkw_lynda_pmt_e_pdv_c_ext__plc__trg__agid_5454775506_cmid_34839966_adp_1t1_net_g&lpk35=9137">Lynda</a>, and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/?searchsegment=ppcbrand&aid=701j0000002BMf7AAG&promo=&oid=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=CS_Brand-google&utm_content=&utm_term=&gclid=CL2b8_nl3NICFQmIfgoda48P-A">Code School</a>.</p>
	<p>I’m pretty much a Utahan native but with a little bit of California sunshine in my blood that I got during my early years. So yes, as popular Utah stereotypes go, i do love fry sauce.</p>
	<p>I’m a big fan of the podcasts Radiolab and 99% Invisible where i actually had the cool opportunity to see a live episode by Roman Mars at GitHub’s Universe last year which made it the icing to an amazing GitHub style vanilla cake.</p>
